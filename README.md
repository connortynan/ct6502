MOS6502 emulator in C++ 
Only implements legal opcodes. All illegal opcodes terminate the program but can be changed to a NOP relatively easily.
Also has a simple testing program to step through instructions and view memory.

This was a fun way to learn about assembly and low-level languages, and I am planning on using this for a larger project in the future.
I followed along with javidx9's tutorial video and [project](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES), as well as [gianlucag's implementation](https://github.com/gianlucag/mos6502/tree/master).
